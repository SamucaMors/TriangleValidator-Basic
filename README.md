# Triangle Validator - Basic

## Description
This project is a basic implementation of a triangle validator program. It checks if three sides can form a valid triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem and calculates its area using Heron's formula.

This is the first project in a series of three, showcasing a beginner-level implementation without modular methods or object-oriented programming.

## Features
- Validates if the three sides can form a triangle.
- Calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula.
- Compares the areas of two triangles (Triangle X and Triangle Y) and determines which is larger.

## How to Run
